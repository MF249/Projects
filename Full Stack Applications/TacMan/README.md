# Contact-Manager

Remote database
Use a LAMP stack.
Use JSON to communicate between client and server. During the presentation, you must show access to at least one API endpoint using SwaggerHub.
You will use a web page as the client. (A web page must be AJAX enabled that accesses the API.)

The program is a personal contact manager. Each user needs a login. If someone does not have an account, you need to offer a registration/signup mechanism. For each user, they can add their own contacts (not shared contacts). They can search for, edit, and delete contacts. When the initial page appears, users can either log in or sign up (register).
